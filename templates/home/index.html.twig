             Simply indicate where you are going, when you are leaving and where you would like to pick up and drop off passengers.

Choose from our list of favorite places to pick up and drop off passengers. It's more convenient for everyone!
            </p>
            <p>
          When a passenger books your ride, we give you their number in case you need to contact them.

You can check the information related to your trip and your passengers at any time, from your listing.

            <h3>How to trust other members?</h3>
            <p>Trust is one of the pillars of the Aya Winek community. Thus, each member is invited to add his photo, write his minibio and leave reviews to help you get to know him better before traveling together.

Will my passenger be on time? Is the driver safe? Reviews left with community members can answer these questions before you even meet them.

On our side, we take care of checking that the email addresses and phone numbers are valid.
